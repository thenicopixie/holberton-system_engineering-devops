# Loops, conditions and parsing
### What I should learn:
- How to create SSH keys.
- What is the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`.
- How to use `while`, `until` and `for` loops.
- How to use `if`, `else`, `elif` and `case` condition statements.
- How to use the `cut` command.
- What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them.

### Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
- Not allowed to use `awk`.
- Bash script must pass `Shellcheck` (version `0.3.3-1~ubuntu14.04.1` via `apt-get`) without any error.
- The first line of the Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing.
